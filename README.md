# PEC2 - Dungeon 2D

## Screen Management
For this PEC2 I implemented a game screen manager system to keep the screen code organized in different files.\
I added a LOGO screen to see a logo shading in and shading out.\
A TITLE screen where the user can select to play the game or to exit the game.\
An OPTIONS screen that is empty, to implement a configuration screen in the future.\
And a GAMEPLAY screen where the game logic and textures are implemented.\
\
I could not add music or sound effects in this game.

## Modify tilemap loading
I improved the function LoadTileMap() so that the tiles of the different maps can be loaded as a BMP image.\
Added a new tileset to change the game feeling and to have different maps to add multiple levels to the game.\
Also implement an additional layer to place some decorative objects in the levels and a collision map to make it transitable or not.

## Enemy
Implement the functionality of an enemy than could kill the player and finish the game.\
This enemy is a static image that throws projectiles on the four different directions to add difficulty to the game.\
\
I hope you enjoy the game.\
Thanks!\
